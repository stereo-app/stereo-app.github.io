Remember to be patient, blink as little as possible and be focused behind the stereogram.

* A. Close up
	1. Put your face close to the screen, try to look through the phone as if you are looking behind the screen.
	2. Try not to blink, start moving the phone away from you very slowly. Your eyes will be trying to refocus on the image, force your eyes not to. Keep looking through the screen and moving it away from you very slowly.
	3. At some distance, patterns will start overlapping each other, and the image will start changing shape. That is a good sign. Keep this distance steady, keep defocusing your eyes behind the screen.
	4. Between the blurry images, some 3 D pictures should appear :) keep staring and allowing your eyes to adjust. After a few seconds or minutes very sharp image will appear.
	5. Congratulations you saw your first Stereogram :)

* B. Black dots

	1. Look at the 2 black dots, Relax your eyes until you see 4 dots. Try to bring 2 middle dots together so you see 3 dots. Use the same principle for stereograms.

* 	C. Look Through

	1. Find an object in front of you - a painting on the wall, a lamp on the table.
	2. Keep looking at the object while slowly bringing the stereogram from low to high until it blocks the object. Your eyes have to be focused behind on the chosen object.
	3. Once you manage to keep your focus on the object and not on the stereogram, try slowly moving the stereogram towards or away from you. At some distance you will see the hidden image in the stereogram.
	4. Once you can see blurry 3D picture, keep looking at it this way until it becomes sharp and recognisable.
