<p>It takes both eyes working synchronously to win this game. Sadly most pirates will not be able to solve the levels as two eyes are needed.</p>

<p>Our player has to solve colourful stereograms and find 3D images hiding in them.</p>

<p>Solving stereograms takes a little bit of training for the beginners. To help with that the App offers tutorial which gives you different tips how to change your eyes focus so that the hidden 3D image appears.</p>

<p>If it is your first encounter with stereograms you will be impressed with your brain's ability to look through the colorful background and find the solutions for different levels.</p>

<p>Not only you will get better understanding of your vision, be teased by the illusions but you will also train your vision.</p>

<p>Stereograms are used by optometrists to improve their patients' depth perception, focus flexibility and treat convergence insufficiency. Depth perception helps you to accurately and quickly judge the distance between you and an object. It is an important skill when driving or parking a car, playing sports or overcoming clumsiness. Focus Flexibility or eyes ability to accommodate declines to most people above 40 years old. This is the ability to change focus from a faraway object to a near one, or vice versa. Therefore many adults need reading glasses. Stereo helps you to improve eyes ability to accommodate.</p>

<p>Train your vision and explore the hidden world!</p>
